## What is nRF24L01?
![logo](https://core-electronics.com.au/media/catalog/product/cache/d5cf359726a1656c2b36f3682d3bbc67/c/o/com-00690-1.png)

The NRF24L01 is a wireless transceiver RF module, where each module can send and receive data. Since it operates on the 2.4 GHz ISM band, the technology is approved for engineering applications in almost all countries. This module can cover 100 meters (200 feet) when operated efficiently, making it suitable for wireless remote control projects.

The NRF24L01 module is powered by 3.3 Volts, so it can be easily used in both 3.2 Volts and 5 Volts systems. Each module has an address range of 125 to communicate with the other 6 modules and also allows several wireless units to communicate with each other in a specified location. Therefore, mesh and other types of networks use this module.

NRF24L01 is a radio transceiver module (SPI protocol) used to send and receive data at ISM operating frequency from 2.4 to 2.5 GHz. This transceiver module is composed of a frequency generator, beat controller, power amplifier, crystal oscillator modulator, and demodulator. It consumes only 11.3 mA at 0 dBm transmit power and consumes 13.5 mA in receive mode.

The high over-the-air data rate combined with sleep mode is highly preferred for ultra-low power applications. The internal voltage regulator controls the high power rejection ratio and power band. The module is compact and can be easily used in confined spaces.
